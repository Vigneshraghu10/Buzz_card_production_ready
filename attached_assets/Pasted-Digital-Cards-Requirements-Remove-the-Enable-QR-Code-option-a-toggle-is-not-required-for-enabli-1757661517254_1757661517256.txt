Digital Cards Requirements

Remove the "Enable QR Code" option – a toggle is not required for enabling or disabling the QR code.

QR Code with Company Logo – When a user uploads their company logo, it should appear clearly in the center of the generated QR code on the digital card. (This replaces the enable/disable feature.)

Ensure the company logo is displayed clearly and at a proper visible size. Currently, some uploaded logos appear too small.

Fix PNG Download – The downloaded PNG should include text, QR code, company logo, and profile image.

Currently, only text is included.

After downloading, ensure the company logo, profile image, and QR code are clearly visible in the PNG file.

Free/Paid Plan Limits – Both free and paid users should be able to generate and store up to 10 business cards maximum (no restrictions during the free trial).

Add a Refresh Option – After saving a profile:

The page should refresh automatically to show an empty form for creating a new card.

The existing card should be successfully stored in Digital Card Management.

If the user has already created the maximum (10) cards, show a message notification about the limit.

Digital Card Management

Allow users to download the digital card as a PNG.

On the dashboard, do not display “digital card limits.” Only show the number of saved digital cards.

AI Card Scanner

Add a feedback form that pops up with a smooth, animated effect inside the AI Card Scanner module.

In the feedback form, users should be able to:

Give a rating (e.g., stars or slider).

Write a comment (text input).

The feedback popup should be advanced and visually attractive, with engaging animations to encourage user interaction.
